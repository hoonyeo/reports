## Why Type Script?

>We love TypeScript for many things… With TypeScript, several of our team members have said things like 'I now actually understand most of our own code!' because they can easily traverse it and understand relationships much better. And we’ve found several bugs via TypeScript’s checks.”

>“One of Ionic's main goals is to make app development as quick and easy as possible, and the tooling support TypeScript gives us with autocompletion, type checking and source documentation really aligns with that.”
